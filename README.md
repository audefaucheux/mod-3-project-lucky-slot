# The Lucky Sloth

The Lucky Sloth is a slot machine simulator. When entering a new user name, you get £100 allocated (not real money !). You need to bet a minimum of £10 to spin the slot machine. If you get 3 identical images, you will win 5 times your bet amount. Otherwise, you will loose the bet amount.
Have fun !
